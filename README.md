# kotlin-from-groovy

This may evolve into a library allowing using Kotlin-ish syntax to do Kotlin-ish things from Groovy.

In particular:

* Deconstruct data classes / classes with components
* Use named and defaulted arguments
* Use data class copy methods

At the moment it's just a skeleton and (failing) tests. Contributions welcome!
